# Debug Tool
This example includes a simple Go script to debug the content of a record. You can run the debugger simply by running the script specifying the server address and the roomName (record key) you want to gather messages from:
```
$ go run debug.go -d /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/37615/p2p/12D3KooWSRvCLEGisZZMGRiCbzgwpQ4v9gc42tT2VHwZTYYKWfCq -room r3 
```
