/*
Package xr implements the Syntactic Representation of smart records.
This is the data model used by protocol and application developers
to interact with smart records. In their current implementation smart-records can
be transformed into the IPLD data model, and be serialized/desearialized seamlessly for
transmission or any other purpose.
